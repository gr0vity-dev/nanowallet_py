# Nano Wallet Concurrent Sends with Retry

## Overview

Nano's blockchain design inherently limits a single account to one pending state block at a time. When attempting concurrent operations from the same account, only one will succeed while others will fail with "Fork" errors.

This extension to the `nanowallet_py` library adds automatic retry capability for handling concurrent sends, allowing applications to simply queue multiple operations while letting the wallet library handle sequencing issues.

## How It Works

### The Concurrency Problem

In Nano:
1. Each account has a sequential chain of blocks
2. Each new block must reference the previous block's hash as its "previous" field
3. If multiple transactions are created concurrently using the same "previous" hash, only one can be accepted
4. Others will be rejected with "Fork" errors

### The Retry Solution

The retry mechanism:
1. Detects specific error messages that indicate temporary concurrency issues
2. Automatically reloads the account's state to get the latest frontier
3. Rebuilds the transaction with the updated frontier
4. Uses exponential backoff for retries (increasing delays between attempts)
5. Continues until success or max retries reached

## New Methods

Two new methods have been added to the `NanoWalletKey` class:

```python
async def send_with_retry(
    self,
    destination_account: str,
    amount: Decimal | str | int,
    max_retries: int = 5,
    retry_delay_base: float = 0.1,
    retry_delay_backoff: float = 1.5,
    wait_confirmation: bool = False,
    timeout: int = 30
) -> str:
    """
    Attempts to send Nano with automatic retries on concurrency errors.
    Returns the hash of the successful block or raises an exception.
    """
```

```python
async def send_raw_with_retry(
    self,
    destination_account: str,
    amount_raw: int | str,
    max_retries: int = 5,
    retry_delay_base: float = 0.1,
    retry_delay_backoff: float = 1.5,
    wait_confirmation: bool = False,
    timeout: int = 30
) -> str:
    """
    Attempts to send raw Nano amount with automatic retries on concurrency errors.
    Returns the hash of the successful block or raises an exception.
    """
```

## Usage Example

```python
import asyncio
from decimal import Decimal
from nanowallet import NanoWalletKey, NanoWalletRpc, WalletConfig

async def main():
    # Set up wallet
    rpc = NanoWalletRpc(url="http://localhost:7076")
    wallet = NanoWalletKey(rpc=rpc, private_key="YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY")
    
    # Create multiple concurrent sends (will retry automatically)
    tasks = []
    for i in range(5):
        destination = f"nano_destination{i}"
        task = wallet.send_with_retry(
            destination_account=destination,
            amount=Decimal("0.000001"),
            max_retries=5,
            retry_delay_base=0.15,
            retry_delay_backoff=1.7
        )
        tasks.append(task)
    
    # Run all tasks and wait for completion
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
    
    # All successful sends will have their block hashes returned
    for i, result in enumerate(results):
        if result.success:
            print(f"Send {i} succeeded with hash: {result.value}")
        else:
            print(f"Send {i} failed: {result.error}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Performance Considerations

Using the retry mechanism incurs a time penalty:
- Without retry: Operations run truly concurrently, but most fail (only one succeeds)
- With retry: Operations become effectively sequential, but all succeed
- The total time increases linearly with the number of operations

## Test Results Comparison

### Without Retry (5 concurrent sends):
- Success rate: 20% (1 of 5)
- Total duration: ~0.35 seconds
- Most operations fail with "Fork" errors

### With Retry (5 concurrent sends):
- Success rate: 100% (5 of 5)
- Total duration: ~3.3 seconds
- All operations eventually succeed

## When to Use

Use the retry mechanism when:
- Success of all operations is more important than speed
- You need to queue multiple send operations from one account
- You want to automate handling of concurrency-related errors

Stick with regular send when:
- Absolute minimum latency is required for the first operation
- You're implementing a custom retry strategy
- You're sending from different accounts (no concurrency issues)
